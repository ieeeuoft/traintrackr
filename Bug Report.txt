Bug Report:
- Python code bugged at around 9:50 am - vehicle 648 was being tracked but looks like it was deadheading - it didn't have a next stop or a schedule so code threw an exception - error message:

	Traceback (most recent call last):
		File ..., line 76 in <module>
			positions = getPositions()
		File ... , line 43, in getPositions
			if trip["next_stop"]["stop_id"] == "SCTH" or trip["next_stop"]["stop_id"] == "NI";
		KeyError: 'next_stop'

Bug Report:
- Express trains (trip 1961) was read, but spotty - sometimes the lights turn on, sometimes they don't, sometimes it skips stops, etc.
- Trains waiting as West Harbour going E/B are shown 1 LED past West Harbour
- Python code bugged at around 9:50 am - vehicle 648 was being tracked but looks like it was deadheading - it didn't have a next stop or a schedule so code threw an exception - error message:

	Traceback (most recent call last):
		File ..., line 76 in <module>
			positions = getPositions()
		File ... , line 43, in getPositions
			if trip["next_stop"]["stop_id"] == "SCTH" or trip["next_stop"]["stop_id"] == "NI";
		KeyError: 'next_stop'

- West Harbour E/B light doesn't seem to be programmed correctly - doesn't turn on (though is functional)
